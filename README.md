Mosaic tile simulation

This is a minimal version of the software used in my siggraph 2001 paper: "Simulating Decorative Mosaics".  The paper is online at the University of Toronto's CS department website:

I haven't tried to compile the software recently, but I'm including a MS Windows executable, which might work on your machine (I think it needs an older version of the Visual Studio Runtime to run).  Since it uses the GLUT and glui libraries, I don't think you'll succeed, but it you do, please let me know.

Since I wrote this code in 2006, my C++ skills have improved, and I'm sure it shows.
